**`College Student`**

I am a senior data science student with a passion for using data science for sports. Currently looking for a data science or software engineering job, and willing to relocate anywhere. I am also technically skilled in mathematics, and spent the summer of 2023 researching graph theory, specifically looking at k-steps traversal labelings of combined cycle graphs.
